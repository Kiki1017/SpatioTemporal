0.1.0 - 2010-06-15 - First released version (TIES2010)


0.1.1 - 2010-06-28 - Minor fixes of functions
Updates:
function: default.LUR.list
fix: Changed default behavious so that it now picks all variabels 
 and not a number equal to the temporal trends

 of drop=FALSE added)

  spatiotemporal covariates
